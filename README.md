0. use str.maketrans to decipher the purple words, then apply the same method to the URL: map -> ocr
0. find out english characters in page source: equality
0. use regex (`re`) to find aAAA<strong>a</strong>AAAa in page source: linkedlist
0. click the image, then use `urllib` to do the loop and be noticed if there is anything unexpected: peak
0. pronounce 'peak hell' -> use `pickle` to deciper banner.p (Windows EOL will fail pickle, convert it to UNIX EOL first!), and plot the resulted 2D array: channel
0. .html -> .zip (check readme.txt in it), use `zipfile` to do the loop and show the comments: hockey
0. hockey -> oxygen (check the letters in last challenge's output), use `PIL` (install `pillow` instead) to extract the grey bar: integrity
0. use `gz2` to decipher the codes in page source: huge/file
0. use `pillow` to plot the two sets of coordinates in the page source: bull (not cow...)
0. click the bull in image to get the initial sequence, count the consecutive repeated characters (abbbcc -> 1a3b2c): 5808
0. extract pixels with (odd, odd) or (even, even) coordinates in image: evil
0. image URL is evil1 -> try 2&3&4&5...-> download evil2.gfx -> split the file into five parts, one byte by one byte: dis-pro-port-ional
0. use `xmlrpc` to find out details of [the failed XML-RPC method](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7950297/faultcode-105-faultstring-xml-error-invalid-document-end-at-line-1-column-1), then use `urllib` to download the evil4.jpg (failed to display in browser, remember?) in last challenge to get the devil name (Bert), finally use `xmlrpc.client` to phone the devil: italy
